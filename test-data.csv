"Ethiopia’s Mesob One-Stop Service Centre Imperative to Have Full Sovereignty on Data, Says Indian Ambassador - ENA English - ENA

Addis Ababa, May 1, 2025 (ENA)— Ethiopia’s newly inaugurated Mesob One-Stop Service Centre is state-of-art and technology driven service center, confirming the country is in a position to have the full sovereignty of on your data, Indian Ambassador to Ethiopia said.

Ambassadors of India and Russia have commended the significant role of Mesobo One-Stop Service Center in enhancing service efficiency and accessibility.

Ambassadors of various countries based in Addis Ababa along with President Taye Atske Selassie visited the newly inaugurated One-Stop Service Center on Wednesday.

 The center, officially launched by Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed, brought together 12 institutions and over 40 services under one-stop, enabling citizens to access essential government services faster and conveniently.


 

 During the visit, Indian Ambassador to Ethiopia, Anil Kumar Rai, described the center as “eye-opening” and praised the Ethiopian government’s planning and research in establishing a technology-driven, citizen-focused service hub.

 The Ambassador expressed the importance of data sovereignty, commending the locally developed technology which ensures that all information or the data is kept within Ethiopia’s own databases guaranteeing its data sovereignty.

“The most interesting part is that the technology has been locally produced, and you have taken great care in ensuring that the data, which is the new resource for the world, is kept in your own servers, so that you are in a position to have the full sovereignty of your data.”

 Providing services will also be phenomenally fast which makes the services accessible, and fast, and affordable, the ambassador said, adding that if the Ethiopians want to scale up in other parts of the country with this experience, they can do it much more easily. 

On his Part, Russian Ambassador to Ethiopia, Evgeny Terkin also expressed his admiration, drawing parallels with similar establishments in his home country.


 

 It is really a wonderful initiative and a wonderful establishment. It adds value to the time-saving service in today’s fast-paced world, he added.

 “Time is irreplaceable. People often spend hours or even days moving between offices to handle various tasks,” he said, adding, “This center allows them to complete multiple services in one place, making it possible for them to use their time more meaningfully.”

"BRICS Membership Serving As Impetus for Ethiopia's Economic Growth, Global Standing: Ambassador Terekhin - ENA English - ENA

Addis Ababa, May 7, 2025 (ENA) -- Ethiopia's accession to the BRICS is serving the country as a significant impetus for both economic growth and enhanced global standing, Russia's Ambassador Yevgeny Terekhin said.

The membership is opening up crucial avenues for development financing, technical expertise, and new market opportunities for the nation, the Russian ambassador to Ethiopia added.

In an exclusive interview with ENA, Ambassador Terekhin stressed that BRICS membership ""provides Ethiopia with access to important mechanisms for economic development and international cooperation.""

Beyond the economic advantages, Ambassador Terekhin sees Ethiopia's role in BRICS as bolstering its influence in global political affairs. 

""The organization provides a platform for advocating reforms in international governance structures and promoting development models that reflect diverse national peculiarities,"" he stated.

With respect to relations with Russia, one of the members of the RRICS, Ambassador Terekhin pointed out that ""Ethiopia's accession has become a powerful catalyst for strengthening economic cooperation between our countries."" 

According to the ambassador, Ethiopia's historical leadership in advocating African interests complements Russia's efforts to create a more equitable international system, allowing the two countries to more effectively advance shared priorities and address common challenges, ranging from climate change to trade barriers within the BRICS framework. 

Russia's experience within the group has allowed it to help Ethiopian colleagues understand how to maximize benefits from this partnership, including participation in business forums, financial cooperation initiatives, and policy coordination mechanisms.

Ambassador Terekhin further detailed the broader strengthening of economic ties between Russia and Ethiopia. 

This positive trend reflects the genuine interest of businesses from both nations in expanding cooperation. 

He revealed that the Russian Trade Representation in Addis Ababa is actively receiving ""multiple inquiries from companies eager to explore opportunities in the Ethiopian market.

Russian and Ethiopian businesses are also collaborating across a wide array of sectors, including ""automotive manufacturing, energy development, electrical equipment, chemical production, food processing, pharmaceutical research, transportation systems, and digital technologies."" 

Ambassador Terekhin specifically mentioned agriculture as remaining ""particularly important, considering its central role in Ethiopia's economy.

Moreover, the Russian Embassy and trade representatives are working to support these initiatives, aiming to overcome challenges and create favorable conditions for business development, he stated.

Drawing on historical ties, the ambassador recalled that between the 1970s and 1990s, 43 major projects were implemented in Ethiopia with Soviet assistance, including the tractor assembly plant in Adama and the Melka-Wakana Hydropower Plant. 

This legacy of successful collaboration creates a strong foundation for current and future joint endeavors, he underscored.

For the ambassador, Ethiopia's Special Economic Zones (SEZs) are ""promising opportunities for Russian businesses looking to establish or expand their presence in Africa."" 

These zones offer advantages such as streamlined one-stop shop processes, tax and customs incentives, and necessary infrastructure.

Ambassador Terekhin believes that Russian companies are ""well-positioned to participate in these initiatives and use Ethiopia as a gateway to the broader African market.""",-0.4065321385860440,5.91234302520752,"BRICS Membership Serving As Impetus for Ethiopia's Economic Growth, Global Standing: Ambassador Terekhin - ENA English - ENA",https://www.ena.et/web/eng/w/eng_6551563,3.0,3.0,3.0,0.0,2,RUSSIA,AMBASSADOR | RUSSIAN,RUS,RUS,ET,2025-05-07,2025-05-07,['USE UNCONVENTIONAL MASS VIOLENCE\\'],0,"BRICS Membership Serving As Impetus for Ethiopia's Economic Growth, Global Standing: Ambassador Terekhin - ENA English - ENA","Addis Ababa, May 7, 2025 (ENA) -- Ethiopia's accession to the BRICS is serving the country as a significant impetus for both economic growth and enhanced global standing, Russia's Ambassador Yevgeny Terekhin said.

Addis Ababa, April 23, 2025 (ENA)— African nations need to forge their disease prevention and control capabilities by investing in modern laboratory infrastructure and skilled health workforce, Minister of Health Dr. Mekdes Daba stressed.

At the opening of the first Russian-African Sanitation and Emergency Rapid Response Team training seminar in Addis Ababa, Health Minister Mekdes stressed the need for strengthening Africa's public health response capacity.

 The three-day seminar brought together experts from 15 African nations, including Ethiopia, to enhance rapid response and research-based service capabilities.

 As part of a collaborative effort to modernize Ethiopia's health infrastructure, the modern mobile laboratory with the capacity to diagnose over 300 diseases was handed over to the ministry today.

The Minister of Health Receiving the laboratory from Anna Y. Popova, Head of the Russian Federal Service for Surveillance on Consumer Rights Protection and Human Wellbeing, Dr.  Mekdes emphasized the commitment of both nations to deepening their partnership in various health-related areas.

 The minister stated that the mobile laboratory will be instrumental in providing vital health services both within Ethiopia and in neighboring countries. ""This facility will not only serve Ethiopia but also neighboring countries, enhancing regional health cooperation and epidemic readiness,"" she emphasized.


 

Furthermore, she emphasized the crucial role of Ethiopia's existing health research institutions, such as the Ethiopian Public Health Institute and the Armauer Hansen Research Institute, stressing the importance of strengthening and expanding these facilities to bolster disease prevention efforts

Africa is home to vital health research institutions, including the Africa CDC, she stated, emphasizing, ""We must build on these foundations, enhancing laboratory manpower, and leverage strong partnerships, like the one we have with Russia, to protect our people.""

Dr. Mekdes further noted that Ethiopia currently operates 33 laboratories and aims to increase this number to 40, thereby strengthening the country's capacity for national and regional disease surveillance and response.

Anna Y. Popova, Head of Russia’s Federal Service for the Protection of Consumer Rights and Human Wellbeing, commended the shared resilience and unity of the Ethiopian and Russian people.

Just as Ethiopians stood strong for its unity and against past invasions, today’s fight is against disease. This partnership ensures Africans can protect themselves sustainably, she stated.

Africa’s health problems must be met with African solutions, she asserted. However, we cannot achieve this in isolation. We require strategic partners like Russia and enhanced cooperation among AU member states.

She advocated for greater investment in health institutions such as the Africa Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, alongside the establishment of robust financial mechanisms within the continent to ensure sustainable health outcomes.


 

We deeply appreciate Russia’s strategic partnership in supporting the African Union’s Agenda 2063, a vision for a healthy, self-reliant, and prosperous Africa, she concluded.

"U.S. Resumes Military Aid and Intelligence Sharing as Ukraine Backs 30-Day Ceasefire Plan | Democracy Now!

Ukraine has agreed to a Trump administration proposal for a 30-day ceasefire with Russia as the United States resumes military assistance and intelligence sharing with Kyiv. In exchange, Ukraine has agreed to sign a deal granting U.S. access to Ukraine’s oil, natural gas and mineral resources “as soon as possible.” President Volodymyr Zelensky said in his nightly video address to Ukrainians that he had accepted the deal, following talks in Saudi Arabia. 

President Volodymyr Zelensky: “During today’s talks, the American side proposed taking a first step forward, establishing a full ceasefire for 30 days, not just stopping missiles, drones and bombs, not just ensuring security in the Black Sea, but implementing a complete ceasefire along the entire frontline. Ukraine welcomes this proposal. We see it as a positive and are ready to take this step.”

U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said he would press Moscow to agree to the deal, adding, “The ball is now in their court.” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Russian officials were scrutinizing publicly released statements about the ceasefire proposal and did not rule out a phone call between Putin and Trump in the coming days.

"Inside the movement to elect a woman as UN secretary general | The BMJ

In its 80 year history, the United Nations has been exclusively ruled by men. A growing movement is calling for women’s leadership of the international body to help bring about reform and strengthen global health

Secretive. Haphazard. A game of thrones. These are ways in which the selection process for the world’s top civil servant—the secretary general of the United Nations (UN)—has been described.

The UN is an intergovernmental group of 193 nations or “member states,” formed in 1945 to maintain international peace and security. It has a major impact on global health. Former UN secretary general Kofi Annan, for example, negotiated lifesaving access to antiretroviral drugs and started the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV and AIDS (UNAIDS) to coordinate the world’s efforts to drive down HIV infections. Another former secretary general, Ban ki-Moon, established the Every Women, Every Child programme that mobilised unprecedented political and global investments to improve women’s and children’s lives.

Bringing stability and a consensus on action against global threats is the chief role of the organisation. The current political upheavals, economic insecurity, wars, and pandemic threat seen across the globe make the UN’s top job vital. And because the UN’s health agency—the World Health Organization (WHO)—faces steep defunding,1 the next secretary general will be key to positioning global health goals in the UN and multilateral system for the next decade and beyond.

In its 80 year history, every UN leader has been a man, appointed through an opaque process likened to the papal conclave. Candidates are usually nominated by their own governments and put to a vote. The voting is restricted to the 15 member states that comprise the UN security council. It takes place in secret and goes through multiple rounds—often with much political trading for votes.
